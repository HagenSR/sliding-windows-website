# Sliding Windows Website

This website allows for variable large window curvature operations on geospatial elevation data and for it's display. It builds off of work done at [The sliding windows library](https://github.com/amdenton/SlidingWindows). This project was a product of my masters thesis.

Geospatial elevation data can be found [here](https://lidar.dwr.nd.gov/)
